# Image Email Spam/Ham Classifier using Pytesseract and OCR

## Overview

This project is a simple Image Email Spam/Ham Classifier that utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) through Pytesseract. The aim is to classify emails as spam or ham based on the textual content extracted from images using OCR.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing consists of images containing email content labeled as spam or ham. Ensure that you have the dataset available and properly organized.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

#
    python predict.py path/to/new/image.jpg
    ```

## Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model's performance by analyzing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results will be displayed after training and testing.

## Additional Notes

- Make sure to adjust the paths and configurations in the scripts according to your dataset structure.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters and consider using additional preprocessing techniques for better performance.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code according to your specific requirements. Happy coding!
